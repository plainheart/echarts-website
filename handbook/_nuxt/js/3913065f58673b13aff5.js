By looking at the documentation and using the search engine, you can help yourself to solve the problem in the first place without relying on the community for help.\r\n\r\nTherefore, before doing anything else, make sure that existing documentation and other resources do not solve your problem. Reources that can be helpful include:\r\n\r\n- [API](${mainSitePath}/api.html)\r\n- [Option Manual](${mainSitePath}/option.html): you can try to use the search function\r\n- Articles in this handbook\r\n- [FAQ](${mainSitePath}/faq.html)\r\n- Searching in [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues)\r\n- Using the search engine\r\n\r\n### Create the Minimal Reproducible Demo\r\n\r\nCreate an example on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/Ovilia/pen/dyYWXWM), [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/mystifying-bash-2uthz), which will make it easier for others to reproduce your problem.\r\n\r\nThe example should reproduce your problem in the simplest way possible. Removing unnecessary code and data will allow those who help you to locate the problem more quickly, thus allowing your problem to be solved more quickly. See [How to Create a Minimal, Reproducible Example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) for a more detailed description.\r\n\r\n### Determining if It's a Bug\r\n\r\n#### Report a Bug or Request a New Feature\r\n\r\nIf it doesn't match the documentation or your intended result, it's probably a bug. If it's a bug, or you have a feature request, use the [issue template](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-issue-helper/) to create a new issue and follow the prompts to describe it in detail.\r\n\r\n#### How-To Questions\r\n\r\nIf it's not a bug, but you don't know how to achieve something, try the <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com\">stackoverflow.com</a>\r\n\r\nIf you don't get an answer, you can also send an email to the email group [dev@echarts.apache.org](mailto:dev@echarts.apache.org). In order for more people to understand your question and to get help in future searches, it is highly recommended to send emails in English.\r\n\r\n## Non-technical questions\r\n\r\nOther questions can be sent in English to the mail group [dev@echarts.apache.org](mailto:dev@echarts.apache.org).\r\n"}}]);
